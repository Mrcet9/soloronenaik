            <h2>Policy Overview</h2>
            <p>Solar energy policies govern the installation, operation, and maintenance of solar systems. These policies aim to promote the use of renewable energy sources, reduce carbon emissions, and provide incentives for individuals and businesses to adopt solar power.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Net Metering: Credit for excess energy sent back to the grid.</li>
                <li>Tax Credits: Federal and state tax credits for solar installations.</li>
                <li>Regulations: Compliance with building codes and local regulations.</li>
                <li>Energy Buyback Programs: Selling excess energy to utility companies.</li>
