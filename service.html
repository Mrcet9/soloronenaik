        <h1>Solar Services</h1>
        
        <h2>Solar Panel Installation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Site Assessment</strong>: Technicians visit the site to evaluate roof or ground conditions, sunlight exposure, and energy needs.</li>
            <li><strong>System Design</strong>: Engineers design a solar power system tailored to the site's size, energy requirements, and budget.</li>
            <li><strong>Permitting</strong>: Providers handle local permits and paperwork to ensure the system meets regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Installation</strong>: Certified professionals install solar panels, wiring, inverters, and other necessary components.</li>
            <li><strong>Inspection</strong>: After installation, systems are inspected to ensure they meet safety and performance standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solar Power System Maintenance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Panel Cleaning</strong>: Solar panels need occasional cleaning to maintain efficiency, especially in dusty or dirty environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Inverter Servicing</strong>: Inverters, which convert solar energy to usable electricity, may need repairs or replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>System Performance Monitoring</strong>: Providers often offer monitoring services to track energy production and detect issues early.</li>
            <li><strong>Repairs</strong>: If components fail or performance decreases, technicians can service or replace faulty parts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Energy Storage Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Battery Installation</strong>: Solar providers often offer battery systems to store excess energy produced by solar panels for later use.</li>
            <li><strong>Battery Maintenance</strong>: Regular checks ensure the battery system operates efficiently and safely.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup Power Solutions</strong>: Providers may install systems to supply power during outages using solar energy stored in batteries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solar Financing Options</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solar Leasing</strong>: Customers lease the solar panels from the provider instead of purchasing them, often with lower upfront costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Purchase Agreements (PPA)</strong>: The provider installs and maintains the solar system, and the customer pays for the energy produced at a lower rate than traditional energy costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Loans and Grants</strong>: Some providers assist customers in securing loans or grants to finance the installation of solar systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Consultation & Energy Audits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consultations</strong>: Providers may offer consultations to analyze a clientâ€™s energy usage and recommend the appropriate solar system size.</li>
            <li><strong>Net Metering Consultation</strong>: Explanation of how excess energy produced by the system can be sold back to the grid, reducing energy bills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Solar Water Heating</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Installation</strong>: Installation of solar water heating systems to reduce reliance on traditional heating methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance Services</strong>: Maintenance services for solar heaters, including cleaning, part replacement, and system checks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Commercial Solar Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Large-scale Installations</strong>: For businesses and industrial use, providers design and install solar systems tailored to higher energy demands.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Optimization</strong>: Services aimed at optimizing energy consumption for commercial properties through solar solutions.</li>
        </ul>
